      summary: Get Question Related
      description: "Returns questions that the site considers related to those identified
        in {ids}.\n \nThe algorithm for determining if questions are related is not
        documented, and subject to change at any time. Futhermore, these values are
        very heavily cached, and may not update immediately after a question has been
        editted. It is also not guaranteed that a question will be considered related
        to any number (even non-zero) of questions, and a consumer should be able
        to handle a variable number of returned questions.\n \n{ids} can contain up
        to 100 semicolon delimited ids, to find ids programatically look for question_id
        on question objects.\n \nThe sorts accepted by this method operate on the
        follow fields of the question object:\n - activity - last_activity_date\n
        - creation - creation_date\n - votes - score\n - rank - a priority sort by
        site applies, subject to change at any time Does not accept min or max\n  activity
        is the default sort.\n \n It is possible to create moderately complex queries
        using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.\n \nThis method returns a list
        of questions."
